#  (CQUT-PVI) Human-vehicle-interaction-dataset-under-right-turn-unsignalized-intersections
**This dataset is produced by the Key Laboratory of Advanced Manufacturing Technology of the Ministry of Education for Automotive Parts and Components of Chongqing University of Technology**

We selected two traffic scenes with different road conditions for video acquisition. Scene one is the unsignalized right-turn intersection at the intersection of Hongguang Avenue and Hongli Avenue in Banan District, Chongqing, and scene two is the unsignalized right-turn intersection at Longzhou Avenue in Huaxi Street, Banan District, Chongqing


Both intersections were shot in the air by DJ-MINI2 UAV, with a flight height of 25 meters and a maximum flight time of 30 minutes, effective pixels of 12 million, CMOS image sensor, video resolution of 3480Ã—2160, frame rate of 30fps, scene 1 is a two-way four-lane right-turn intersection, and scene 2 is a two-way two-lane right-turn intersection.

The video data was divided into commuting and non-commuting hours, and the weather included cloudy, sunny and cloudy days. Commuting hours were from 5:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and non-commuting hours were from 9:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Three hours per day were collected, for a total of 180 hours. Human-vehicle interactions under peak and lull periods were collected separately. From the large amount of video data, a total of 1000 pedestrians with clear game states were extracted from each scene, for a total of 2000 human-vehicle interaction events and a total of 340,710 data frames.

A total of 4 data sets are included, CP1,CP2,NCP1,NCP2

**Please be patient as the dataset will be subsequently shared as a public dataset in order to promote the progress and collaboration of scientific research in the field of transportation.**
